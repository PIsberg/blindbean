Every `java`/`surefire` invocation against this codebase needs, at minimum:

```
--enable-preview
--add-modules jdk.incubator.vector
--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED
```

These are already wired into `maven-compiler-plugin` and `maven-surefire-plugin` in `pom.xml`. When running the JMH jar or the example module directly, pass them on the command line.

The native library location is controlled by the `blindbean.native.path` system property (read by `FheNativeBridge` when loading symbols). Tests will fail fast if the DLL cannot be found there.
